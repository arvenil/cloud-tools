 Percona Agent 1.0.7
=====================

Percona is glad to announce the release of Percona Agent 1.0.7 on September 5th 2014. Downloads are available from our download site `here <http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-agent/percona-agent-1.0.7/>`_. Percona Agent can be installed or updated as described in the `manual <http://cloud-docs.percona.com/index.html>`_. This version of ``pt-agent`` has been built with with Go MySQL driver ver. `0b000424e5 <https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/commit/0b000424e546f305e0bd47856d5fcb904c1a0eb4>`_.

New Features
------------

 * ``pt-agent`` is now able to gather the detailed system and MySQL server information. This information is gathered by running the ``pt-summary`` and ``pt-mysql-summary`` on a server. Gathered information will be displayed in the System Info section in `Percona Cloud Tools <https://cloud.percona.com/>`_.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 * Count metric which is used for displaying number of samples was missing one sample per minute.

 * If gathering MySQL metrics from server takes to long, it will be skipped to avoid saturating the server even further.

 * Bad data file was causing agent to stop sending but keep spooling the data. Error handling for bad data files has been improved not to cause unnecessary stalls and zero-length data files are now ignored/removed (and cause a warning). 

 * Running ``EXPLAIN`` when ``key_len`` column contained more than one value wasn't supported.
