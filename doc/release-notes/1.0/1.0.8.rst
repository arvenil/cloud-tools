This version of ``pt-agent`` has been built with with Go MySQL driver ver. `0b000424e5 <https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/commit/0b000424e546f305e0bd47856d5fcb904c1a0eb4>`_.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 * The agent could start reporting the same values for metrics, which would produce a flat line for metrics. This regression was caused by fixes for bugs in 1.0.7 release. 

 * Agent was adding up the difference and using that to calculate the average, instead of adding up the rates in order to average the rates. 
 
 * Fixed the typo in the mysql.Monitor warning regarding the skipped interval.
