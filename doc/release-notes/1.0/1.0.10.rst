Bugs Fixed
----------

 * In some cases *Percona Agent* could use all *MySQL* connections which could lead to an outage.
 
 * The installation script did not work with ``--help`` option if the agent was already installed/

 * InnoDB Stats were not re-enabled after MySQL server was restarted.

 * Due to timeout error while closing the websocket, the agent could disconnect from the API without the API noticing it.
 
 * In some cases ``USE database`` lines in the slow query log were not parsed correctly.

 * *MySQL* restart monitor could send false-positive signals which could cause agent to unnecessary restart :ref:`query-analytics`.
