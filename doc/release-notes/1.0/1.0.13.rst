Percona Agent 1.0.13

:Release Date: May 15, 2015

:Installation: http://cloud-docs.percona.com/Agent.html

New Features
------------

* Limited the size of the data spool
  (:file:`/usr/local/percona/percona-agent/data`)
  to 1 hour, 10 MiB, and 100 files.
  Previously, when Percona Agent worked offline for some time
  (for example, because of connection issues)
  this data either filled up disk space indefinitely,
  or caused a network burst after it came back online.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Resolved an issue when queries had ``first_seen`` attribute
  later than ``last_seen`` attribute.
* Fixed crashing of Query Analytics with Performance Schema on null DIGEST.
* Removed warnings like ``strconv.ParseFloat: parsing "ON": invalid syntax``
  from the Percona Agent log.

  Starting from MySQL 5.6 and later versions, ``SHOW GLOBAL STATUS``
  does not contain only number variables.
  This caused Percona Agent to flood the log with warning messages
  when a value of a variable could not be converted.

Other improvements
------------------

* The ``diskv`` package was updated to avoid potential goroutine leaks.
