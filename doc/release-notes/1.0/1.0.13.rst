====================

:Release Date: May 19, 2015
:Download: http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-agent/percona-agent-1.0.13
:Installation: http://cloud-docs.percona.com/Agent.html

New Features
------------

.. rubric:: Real-time Table Info

When using Query Analytics,
you can get ``SHOW CREATE TABLE``,
``SHOW INDEX``, and ``SHOW TABLE STATUS``
for each table used by a query.

.. rubric:: Local data spool limits

Percona Agent saves data locally in
:file:`/usr/local/percona/percona-agent/data`
before sending it to PCT.
This data is now  limited to 1 hour, 10 MiB, and 100 files.

In previous versions, when Percona Agent worked offline for some time
(for example, because of connection issues)
this data either filled up disk space indefinitely,
or caused a network burst after it came back online.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Resolved an issue when queries had ``first_seen`` attribute
  later than ``last_seen`` attribute.
* Fixed crashing of Query Analytics with Performance Schema on null DIGEST.
* Removed warnings like ``strconv.ParseFloat: parsing "ON": invalid syntax``
  from the Percona Agent log.

  As of MySQL 5.6 and later versions, ``SHOW GLOBAL STATUS``
  does not contain only number variables.
  This caused Percona Agent to flood the log with warning messages
  when a value of a variable could not be converted.

Other improvements
------------------

* The ``diskv`` package was updated to avoid potential goroutine leaks.
