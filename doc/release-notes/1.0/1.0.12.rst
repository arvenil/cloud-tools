Bugs Fixed
----------

* Fixed the inability of Percona Agent to parse slow log files generated by Percona Server with slow log rotation.
* Fixed error in Percona Agent install script when it did not pick up the values passed with ``-agent-mysql-user`` and ``-agent-mysql-pass`` options.
* Fixed error that did not allow to run ``EXPLAIN`` on queries with conditional comments.
