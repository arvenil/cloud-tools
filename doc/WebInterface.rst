Percona Cloud Tools  provides a simple and very powerful web interface
for monitoring and analyzing collected MySQL performance data.
You can see your whole infrastructure, manage it, configure,
and analyze collected data to improve performance.

The web interface is located at `cloud.percona.com <http://cloud.percona.com>`_

The top part of the web UI contains various menus in the toolbar,
while the bottom part is reserved for displaying data.

System Info
-----------

*System Info* provides information about the status
and configuration of the server and MySQL instance.
The report is generated by :term:`Percona Agent`
using the :command:`pt-summary` and :command:`pt-mysql-summary` tools
available in :term:`Percona Toolkit`.

To enable *System Info*:

* Install or update Percona Agent to version 1.0.7 or later.
* `Install Percona Toolkit <http://percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.2/installation.html>`_.

To access the *System Info* report, click the **System Info** link
in any server or MySQL instance box in the web UI.

The report is separated into sections that cover various aspects,
such as processor and memory details for server instances,
and table cache and schema details for MySQL instances.
You can copy the whole report or sections of it to the clipboard,
and then paste it into an e-mail without losing the formatting.
